Currently maintained by [@lamabiker](https://github.com/lamabiker), previously maintained by [@mariusandra](https://github.com/mariusandra), originally created by [@alexlafroscia](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/). Development originally sponsored by [Apprentus](https://www.apprentus.com).\n\nFeel free to open issues if you find something. Pull requests are more than welcome!\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\n| Keybinding     | Action                                                                 |\n| :--            | :--                                                                    |\n| ctrl+alt+e     | Toggle between the component/controller and the template               |\n| ctrl+alt+s     | Toggle between the component and the styles/component.sass file        |\n| ctrl+alt+a     | Opens all `.hbs` files where the current component is called           |\n| ctrl+alt+r     | Toggle between the controller and the route                            |\n| ctrl+alt+enter | Jump into templates. Press when cursor over {{forms/super-select ...}} to open templates/components/forms/super-select.hbs |\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command  | Description                                                    |\n| :--      | :--                                                            |\n| Server   | Runs `ember server` in the root folder of the project.         |\n| Test     | Runs `ember test` in the root folder of the project            |\n| Generate | Opens the panel to run a generator                             |\n| Exit     | Stops a currently running process                              |\n| Minimize | Show and hide the output panel, without hiding everything else |\n| Close    | Hide the entire panel                                          |\n\n## Generators\n\nRunning the generators through Atom is really easy.  When you first open the panel, it will bring up a list of file types to generate.  This list is based on the output of `ember g --help`, and therefore should include all future blueprints as well as those added by addons automatically. Once you select a type, you'll be prompted to enter a name, and the output will appear in orange in the bottom panel.\n\n## Help! It's broken!\n\nThat might be the case! But first, check if specifying the path to the Ember and NPM packages fixes your problems.  It probably, hopefully will.  If it doesn't, please file an issue so I can try fixing it!\n\nKnown limitation: make sure your ember project is the first project (first in the list) opened in Atom.\n\n## Settings\n\n| Setting | Purpose | Default Value |\n| :---    | :---    | :---          |\n| Generate Coffeescript     | Have all of the generators make CoffeeScript files instead of Javascript | `false` |\n| Path To Ember Executable  | Point the CLI helper to the Ember executable on your computer | `/usr/local/bin/ember` |\n| Path To `node` Executable | Point the CLI helper to the `node` executable on your computer | `/usr/local/bin/node` |\n\n## Todo List | Pipeline\n\n- [ ] Add a 'cleaner' tool that scans for unused components\n- [x] Open `ember-cli-helper` automatically if the package uses the Ember CLI\n- [ ] Differentiate a task's button from the others when it is active\n- [ ] Use the editor's theme to get colours for success and error in the command output\n- [ ] Give some sort of visual feedback about the running command when the panel is minimized\n- [x] Include a panel for running the file generators\n- [x] Add convenience shortcuts to switch between component and template (and route and ...)\n- [x] Add option to enter components when clicking something over {{forms/super-select ... }} --> opens components/forms/super-select.js\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSome users have experienced problems running the commands when they opening their project through the `File > Open` menu.  If this happens to you, try opening the project from the command line with the `atom` command see if that fixes the issue.\n\nIf the generators button doesn't work, `ember-cli-helper` probably can't find your ember project. Double check all the paths and make sure your ember project is the first opened project.\n\n***\n\n**Very special thanks** to [@alexlafroscia](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/) for creating the original atom plugin and to [@mariusandra](https://github.com/mariusandra) maintaining it!\n\n**Special thanks** to [@nickclaw](https://github.com/nickclaw/) and his\n[atom-grunt-runner](https://github.com/nickclaw/atom-grunt-runner)\npackage, which was [@alexlafroscia](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/)'s inspiration for building this and a big help in putting it together.\n",
